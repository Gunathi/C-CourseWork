# C-CourseWork
 I created a file-processing machine using KMP Algorithm and C language as my CourseWork assignment.

 In this code, I'm going to find( where and how much ) a  special string in a text file. 
 I have included a sample text file. ( Use it to check this code ).

    Ex:- Enter a search string: Advanced Landscape

         Search Result ::
         * APL8005 Advanced Landscape Design 1 
         * APL8006 Advanced Landscape Design Studio 2
        
         Number of matches: 2  //no of occurrences 

 If you enter the string "Advanced Landscape", it will reply to you with where that phrase is located and how many occurrences it includes.
